2. (a v ~b)     1, I1       #2

QED

#1: At the start of the proof, the user should be prompted with a message in the input / message area to "Start by entering a true wff. This can be any given wff (from gamma), or any wff that matches the form of an equivalence rule, or the value true".
- If they enter a valid wff, it is inserted into the proof area, and they are prompted for the next line. If they enter an invalid or untrue wff, we notify them and ask again

#2: We prompt them for further input slightly differently: now they can apply inference rules.
"Enter a true wff, or apply an equivalence or inference rule to a previous wff".
- Expected input: "1, I1" or "2 E10", ...
- If they enter invalid input or an equivalence rule which can't apply, notify them and prompt again.

#3: At each step, we check the current line against the desired goal: if they match, the proof is done.



===

Definition of a proof: 
- A proof method
- Gamma: a list of wffs which are assumed to be true
- Goal: The final line of the proof
- A sequence of steps
    - Each step is a wff and justification for the truth of that wff based on previous steps or theorems



a = y
b = z


Adding precedence
- need to differentiate parse trees from... logic tree? semantics trees?
    - with precedence, different parse trees could be semantically the same e.g. "(a v b)" and "a v b"
    - they should still parse differently, but all parse trees should be converted into another similar tree object based on the semantics
    - parentheses not needed in this new object: structure of it will be enough


Bugs:
- ~F == T and ~T == F needs to be established


IDEA: shift+space skips any closing ) and adds space

TODO: document and refactor to make code easier to follow

TODO: add allocator args to more stuff eg ParseTree.copy or Node.copy

Idea: make a ComptimeArrayList with basic functionality to clean up comptime code

TODO: add "semantics tree" in different file and refactor Wff.init (wffs should be produced by some other object)
    - change wff.parse_tree to wff.structure
    - the semantics tree should make all higher level code gramamr-agnostic i.e as long as no new operators are introduced, any format in which a wff string is entered and parsed should first be converted to a semantics tree, and any two wffs that are logically equivalent should produced the same semantics tree regardless of their entry and parsing format
    - CURRENT TASK: integrate wfftree in place of parsetree in code

Check out adjacency matrix or edge list for tree internals

Notes for new parse tree to wff tree:
- iterate terminals and find first common ancestor
- iterate deepest terminals first and "fold" up the tree
